# Categorizer for e-commerce

This project is about creating a categorizer, that is, designing a machine learning model so that based on certain features such as "id", "family, "group", etc., it categorizes the entire batch of products of a e-commerce of auto parts.

## Deployment

To do the deployment I have used a platform called Heroku, which is a cloud platform that lets companies and devs, build, deliver, monitor and scale apps, in a very simple way. For this case I made it super simple, you only need to connect your repo with Heroku, once it's connected, click on deploy branch. I'll leave you the app link to see the final result.
